# 2-4: When Merges Go Wrong

![Git Conflict](/img/git-conflict.jpg)

Two objects cannot occupy the same point in space and time, or so say Newtonian physics. While quantum reality may get a little fuzzier on those questions, Git commits do not. During a merge, commits that have different changes in the same file, on the same line results in **merge conflicts**.

Conflicts are uncommon, but also unavoidable when you have a large number of branches or developers for the same project. Sooner or later, somebody will make a change to a file in direct contradiction to somebody else's change.

Git has a process for resolving these conflicts, but it takes getting used to. Let's get ourselves into some trouble!

```shell
git switch -c trouble
echo "This line goes out to the rebels!" >> file1.txt
echo "This line goes out to the dreamers!" >> file2.txt
git commit -am "Who cares about main; I'm doing my own thing"
git switch main
echo "I'm definitely keeping this" >> file1.txt
git commit -am "Add line to file1 that I'm definitely keeping"
git merge trouble
```

Aaaand conflict.

Uh oh. What have we done?!

First, review `git status` to understand the current state of the working tree.

## Conflict Syntax

There's quite a bit of information here. First, we're told the merge did not complete. If we want to back out entirely, we can! We can run `git merge --abort`, and we'll go back to our clean `main`, no harm no foul. But what about that change in `file2.txt`? What if we actually want that? We can't just ignore this problem; we need to confront it head-on. For the first time in this course, I'm going to ask you to use a text editor. Any editor will do, but use it to open `file1.txt`.

What daâ€”Git modified our file for us! Yeah, this is one of the more intrusive Git operations. When there's a conflict in a file, Git will add lines indicating where conflicting sections begin an end. This will always start with the `<<<<<<< HEAD` marker to indicate the current state. Beneath that are all the lines that are currently present in the branch you're on. Then comes `=======` to show the branch separation. Then comes all the lines that differ, until the `>>>>>>>` and branch name. 

## Resolving Conflicts

To sort this mess out, you need to decide which lines stay and which lines go. This is a _manual process_. There are tools that can make it a little easier, and we'll discuss them later, but I want you to be comfortable with how Git presents its raw data. 

I think we want to keep the current branch's version, so let's delete not only the Git markings, but also the incoming line from `trouble`. The file should look like this when done:

```
My first commit!
My second commit!
I wish I hadn't done this
Ah just kidding, I'm good with it
The work goes on
I'm definitely keeping this
```

Save and quit.

We now have to re-stage `file1.txt` and commit our changes to finish the merge.

```shell
git add file1.txt
git merge --continue
```

When we do `git merge --continue`, you'll notice a text editor pops up. You can of course pass `-m` with a message to bypass this. But hey! Our working tree is clean again! 

Run `git log --oneline --graph` to see the fruits of your labor. Look at those pretty branches.

As always, there is a great deal more depth to the topic of conflict resolution, but this is where to start. You'll now have what you need to fix these issue when they arise.

## Check For Understanding

What happens if I make commits to the same file in 2 different branches, but on different lines? Maybe something to test...
