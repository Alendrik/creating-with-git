# 1-1: Every end a Beginning

I'm standing here fresh off the `Creating with Git` course from TTI. I had a lot of fun. But, most importantly, I have a direction to follow on all that I have yet to learn! Now that sounds all fun and exciting, especially since I have a repo to play around with, but what exactly should I do with it?

## Coming up with ideas - Sir, what do you mean by yes?

As I tried to come up with separate ideas worthy of a project, I realized that I can combine lots ofwhat I want to do into one project. I want to publish some documentations to show companies a little more about me. I've also been meaning to figure out a workflow to publish some of my obsidian notes. Lastly, I want to make sure my next project can include git in some fashion. Rather than treating these things as separate ideasn, I'm turning them into one project.


## Turning Ideas -> Project

I had a few main ideas I considered for the mini project moving forward:

* Posting the notes I've taken of this course so far.
* Finding out a way to use my favorite note taking program to publish notes with git-pages.
* Learn as much git along the way!

This led to the formalized project idea:

> Create a new Obsidian Notes vault specifically for publishing with github pages and honkit. This vault will wrap around the publishing directory to make editing pleasant.

### Starting the project - where do I start?

So, I always seek to get ahead of myself and immediately start. While this is not immediately a bad idea, I have to ensure that I put in some effort to research. If I don't, I will end up annoying myself by getting stuck and annoying the poor members of the TTI discord server. (shout out to yall!)

### The plan

Draft the initial plan and research alongside. Shape Chapter 1 to be Project setup and research. In a sort of inception-like way, I've already stated this process by just writing this first page, so I'll just continue along with the research.
